# sql_retail_sales

This project contains a set of SQL queries to analyze retail sales data. The queries are designed to answer common business questions and gain insights from a hypothetical or real retail sales database.

## 📊 Project Description

In this project, I have solved 15 SQL problems related to retail sales data.

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in writing SQL queries for data analysis, including filtering, aggregation, grouping, and performing complex calculations.

## ✅ SQL Questions and Objectives

Below are the questions covered in this project:

1. **Retrieve all columns for sales made on `2022-11-05`.**

    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
    ```

2. **Retrieve all transactions where the category is `Clothing` and the quantity sold is more than 10 in November 2022.**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
      AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'yyyy-mm') = '2022-11'
      AND quantity > 10;
    ```

3. **Calculate the total sales (`total_sale`) for each category.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category;
    ```

4. **Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the `Beauty` category.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(age), 0) AS average_age
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE category = 'Beauty'
    GROUP BY category;
    ```

5. **Find all transactions where the `total_sale` is greater than 1000.**

    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE total_sale > 1000;
    ```

6. **Find the total number of transactions (`transaction_id`) made by each gender in each category.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category, gender
    ORDER BY category;
    ```

7. **Calculate the average sale for each month and find the best-selling month in each year.**

    ```sql
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year, 
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month
    ORDER BY avg_sales DESC
    LIMIT 2;
    ```

8. **Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales.**

    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id, 
           SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

9. **Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category;
    ```

10. **Create a report showing each shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and the number of orders in each shift:**
    - Morning: Time <= 12
    - Afternoon: 12 < Time <= 17
    - Evening: Time > 17

    ```sql
    WITH Hourly_sales AS (
        SELECT *,
            CASE
                WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'morning'
                WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'afternoon'
                ELSE 'evening'
            END AS shift
        FROM retail_sales
    )
    SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
    FROM Hourly_sales
    GROUP BY shift;
    ```
11. **Find the top 1 most popular category based on total sales in the year 2022.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

12. **Calculate the total cost of goods sold (COGS) for each category.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, SUM(cogs) AS total_cogs
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category;
    ```

13. **Find the top 3 product categories with the highest average unit price.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, AVG(price_per_unit) AS avg_unit_price
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY avg_unit_price DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

14. **Find the category with the lowest number of transactions.**

    ```sql
    SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY total_transactions
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

15. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each gender.**

    ```sql
    SELECT gender, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY gender;
    ```
