# sql_retail_sales

This project contains a set of SQL queries to analyze retail sales data. The queries are designed to answer common business questions and gain insights from a hypothetical or real retail sales database.

## üìä Project Description

In this project, I have solved 10 SQL problems related to retail sales data. The dataset includes information such as transaction details, categories, sales amounts, customer demographics, and timestamps.

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in writing SQL queries for data analysis, including filtering, aggregation, grouping, and performing complex calculations.
